LOVE OR HATE
Writers Jack Anglin, Johnnie Wright

It's no surprise that we are parting
Tho' teardrops come to dim my eyes
I could say that it makes no difference
But I'd only be telling myself a lie
(Chorus:)
Tonight I'm going away to leave you
To try to forget my big mistake
Between us there can be no friendship
It's either love or it's hate
All those plans we made together
Now have come to this sad end
The promise you made you have broken
We can no longer be friends
So many times I forgave you
But now I know you'll never do right
No longer do I call you my own
So I'm going out of your sight
(Repeat Chorus
